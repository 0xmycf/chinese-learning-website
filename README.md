# WIP

Since I was very little I wanted to learn Chinese.
  After talking to some friend I decided its finally time to start seriously learning
    the language.
  I am more interested in learning Cantonese than Mandarin though,
    but because the differences in grammar are only little I will study both
    (although only Cantonese pronunciation for now).

This Website is built with *plenti*.
  A static site generator for Svelte.
  I built a yml -> json formatter on top of it,
    so I dont have to write my notes in json.

Additionally a dictionary exists, which can be updated through
    python scripts if a valid anki deck as json is available.

## Python

The repo also contains a python subdir,
    wich holds various python scripts for converting files into other files
    ie. building the actual content of the website.
