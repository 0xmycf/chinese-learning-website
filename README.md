# About this

Since I was very little I wanted to learn Chinese.
  After talking to some friend I decided its finally time to start seriously learning
    the language.
  I am more interested in learning Cantonese than Mandarin though,
    but because the differences in grammar are only little I will study both
    (although only Cantonese pronunciation for now).

This Website is built with *plenti*.
  A static site generator for Svelte.
  I built a markdown -> json formatter on top of it,
    so I dont have to write my notes in json.
